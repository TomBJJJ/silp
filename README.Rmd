# silp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of silp is to execute conditional process analysis with SEM approach

## Installation

You can install the development version of silp like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("TomBJJJ/silp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library("silp")
## basic example code
data = generate_data(100, 0.3, 0.4, c(1,1,1,1), 0.9)
model = "
 fy =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
 fx =~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4
 fz =~ z1 + z2 + z3 + z4
 fy ~  fx + fz + fx:fz
"
fit = silp(model, data)
refit = resilp(fit, 100)
summary(fit)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

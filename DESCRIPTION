Description: The "silp" package utilizes the Reliability-Adjusted Product Indicator (RAPI) method to 
    estimate effects among latent variables, thus allowing for more precise definition and analysis of 
    mediation and moderation models. Our simulation studies reveal that while "silp" may exhibit 
    instability with smaller sample sizes and lower reliability scores (e.g., ùëÅ = 100, ùúî = 0.7), 
    implementing nearest positive definite matrix correction and bootstrap confidence interval 
    estimation can significantly ameliorate this volatility. When these adjustments are applied, 
    "silp" achieves estimations akin in quality to those derived from LMS. In conclusion, the "silp" 
    package is a valuable tool for researchers seeking to explore complex relational structures between 
    variables without resorting to commercial software.
